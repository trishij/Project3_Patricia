        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>I was a music blogger for several years for a jazz website in Los Angeles. I am also a researcher and writer on music history with an emphasis on humanizing the lives of jazz artists. For example, I once wrote a piece about the jazz great Thelonious Monk and the relationship he had with his patron, Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter. Most working musicians are busy gigging and working on creating and performing leaving little time for writing and updating your website and social media. Let me help. Here are just a few of my skills which may assist you:</p>
