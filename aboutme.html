            <p>I have a bachelor's of science degree in marketing and experience in business and economic development, non-profit work and copywriting. In addition, I have a strong passion for the arts. I am a classically trained pianist who began playing piano as a toddler. I later fell in love with jazz and began writing about the history of jazz on a variety of websites and social media. I am available to work with performing artists as a manager and assist them in writing copy to promote their brand and attract audiences on their websites and social media.</p>
